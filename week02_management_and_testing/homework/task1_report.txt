Modelling:
1. fixed noise distribution in the diffusion's forward pass from uniform to normal
2. fixed formula in the diffusion's forward pass (one_minus_alpha_over_prod -> sqrt_one_minus_alpha_prod)
3. fixed time embedding size in unet

Tests:
1. fixed seed

Training:
1. changed normalization constants
2. added inverse normalization at the sample generation stage
